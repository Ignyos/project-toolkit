# PM Branching Guidance (Optional Module)

> Optional add-on to `workflow.md`. Offer this during PM setup (greenfield or existing) as an
> opt-in choice — when the developer declines, none of the rules below apply and branching is left
> entirely to the developer's own judgment.

## Why this exists

Lifecycle state (`backlog/` -> `current/` -> `release-candidate-dev/` -> `release-candidate/` ->
`completed/`) lives in files tracked by git. Without a branching convention, PM housekeeping
commits (creating/editing/moving item files) and feature code commits get tangled together on the
same working branch, making PM history noisy and merges harder to reason about.

## Core principle

Two kinds of changes are treated differently:

- **PM housekeeping changes** — creating, editing, or moving item files under `PM/`. These belong
  on `dev`.
- **Code changes** — everything else. These belong on a dedicated working branch, never committed
  directly to `dev`.

## Branch naming

A working branch for an item is named after its id: `<id>` (for example `feat-014`), optionally
with a short slug appended: `<id>-<slug>` (for example `feat-014-branch-policy`).

## Rule 1 — Adding/editing a PM item while already on `dev`

No special handling needed. Commit the PM item change directly to `dev`.

## Rule 2 — Adding/editing a PM item while on a working branch

The AI must not switch branches or commit on the developer's behalf without confirmation. Suggested
sequence, offered as a strong suggestion (not a hard gate):

1. If the working branch has uncommitted changes, suggest committing them first.
2. Switch to `dev`.
3. Create/edit the PM item and commit it to `dev`.
4. Switch back to the working branch the developer was on.
5. Merge `dev` into the working branch so it picks up the new item.

This sequence is a candidate for a helper script (for example `scripts/pm-sync.ps1`) so the
developer can run one command instead of the AI performing multiple git operations by hand.

## Rule 3 — Starting code work on an existing item while on `dev`

Before any code edit, the AI must strongly suggest creating (or switching to, if it already
exists) a working branch named after the item id, and switch to it before making changes. Do not
begin editing source files on `dev`.

## Rule 4 — Starting code work on a task that has no PM item yet

Before any code edit or branch creation, the AI must strongly suggest creating a trackable item
first (in `backlog/` or `current/` per the normal lifecycle), so the resulting working branch and
its commits can be tied to an id. Only after the item exists should Rule 3 apply.

## Rule 5 — Merging a completed item's working branch back to `dev`

Trigger: the item's code has been confirmed per `workflow.md`'s completion-confirmation gate.
Suggest merging (or opening a PR per Rule 6) the working branch into `dev`, then ask whether to
delete the branch or keep it around for traceability. Advisory.

## Rule 6 — Preferring a PR over a local merge

Trigger: the repository uses branch protection or PR-based review on `dev`. Suggest opening a PR
from the working branch instead of merging locally, and wait for the PR to be completed before
treating the item as merged. If it's unclear which mode the repo uses, ask rather than assume.
Advisory.

## Rule 7 — Working branch has fallen behind `dev`

Trigger: `dev` has advanced with other merged items since the working branch was created. Before
continuing work, or before the Rule 5 merge, suggest merging (or rebasing) `dev` into the working
branch first so the eventual merge is small and current. Advisory.

## Rule 8 — Merge conflict while syncing `dev` into a working branch

Trigger: a conflict occurs during the Rule 2 dev-sync step or the Rule 7 sync. Stop, surface the
conflicting files, and ask the developer how to resolve them. Never auto-resolve a conflict
silently.

## Rule 9 — Item demoted or descoped while its working branch exists

Trigger: the item is moved back to `backlog/` (for example, rejected at the confirmation gate)
while a working branch for it still exists. Ask whether to keep the branch paused for later,
delete it, or fold any salvageable changes elsewhere. Advisory.

## Rule 10 — Switching away from unfinished work

Trigger: the developer wants to start or switch to a different item while the current working
branch has uncommitted changes. Suggest committing or stashing those changes first rather than
switching branches with unsaved work in place. Advisory.

## Rule 11 — Resuming work on an item that already has a branch

Trigger: Rule 3 applies, but a branch named after the item id already exists locally or on the
remote (for example, from a prior session). Suggest checking out the existing branch instead of
creating a new or conflicting one. Advisory.

## Rule 12 — One branch spanning multiple items

Trigger: a single change legitimately addresses more than one tracked item. Suggest either naming
the branch after both ids (for example `bug-014-bug-015`) or asking whether the items should be
split or consolidated into one. Advisory.

## Rule 13 — Branching off another working branch (dependency chain)

Trigger: an item's work depends on unmerged changes in another item's working branch. Suggest
branching from that other working branch rather than from `dev`, and flag the dependency so merge
order is preserved (the dependency must merge before or alongside the dependent item). Advisory.

## Rule 14 — Temptation to commit a small code fix directly to `dev`

Trigger: the developer wants to skip a working branch for a change that feels too small to bother
with one. Still strongly suggest a working branch tied to an item id, so the PM-housekeeping /
code separation from the Core principle holds regardless of change size. Advisory.

## Rule 15 — Avoiding accidental commits on a release branch

Trigger: the current branch is a production/release branch (for example `main`) and a code or PM
edit is about to be made. Stop and warn before proceeding, and suggest switching to `dev` or the
appropriate working branch. Treat this closer to blocking given the risk of contaminating a
release branch.

## Rule 16 — Mixed-purpose dirty working branch

Trigger: a working branch has both code changes and a staged or unstaged PM item edit at the same
time. Suggest splitting them: route the PM edit through the Rule 2 dev-sync sequence separately
from the code commit, rather than committing both together.

## Enforcement style

All rules here are advisory ("strongly suggest") — the AI proposes the sequence and waits for
developer confirmation before acting; it never performs branch switches, merges, or commits
unprompted. This is distinct from the hard branch gates enforced by generated publish scripts
(`publish-dev.ps1`, `publish-live.ps1`, `release.ps1`), which fail closed regardless of
confirmation.

## Extending this file

Add new workflow examples below as additional numbered rules. Each rule should state: the trigger
condition, the current branch, the suggested action sequence, and whether it's advisory or
blocking.
