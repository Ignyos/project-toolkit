# PM Workflow Rules

`project-management.md` is a pure index. This file owns the rules. See `AGENTS.md` for current
direction and priorities — this file only defines process.

## Lifecycle

`backlog/` -> `current/` -> `release-candidate-dev/` -> `release-candidate/` -> `completed/`

Moving an item between folders is a plain file move. Its id (for example `bug-001`, `feat-002`)
never changes.

## Ids and prefixes

Per-prefix counters, not a global counter: `bug-001`, `bug-002`, ... and `feat-001`, `feat-002`, ...
counted separately. Starter prefixes: `bug`, `feat`, `chore`, `task`, `spike`.

## Completion confirmation

Work is done in slices. A slice may cover one item or several. A slice is bounded by the work
actually performed — it is never sized to reduce how often the developer is asked.

- An item is never marked complete, and never leaves `current/`, on AI judgment alone.
- At the end of a slice the AI stops and presents one confirmation request listing every item that
  slice touched. For each item it states what changed, how it was verified, and what was not
  covered.
- The developer answers per item. A single approval covering the whole list is allowed only when
  the developer gives it explicitly; it is never assumed from silence or from a general "looks good".
- Confirmed: update the item file, then perform the folder move.
- Rejected: the item stays where it is and the feedback is appended to its item file so the next
  session does not relitigate it.
- Request first, write second. Marking an item complete in the same turn as asking defeats the gate.
- Only items the slice actually touched appear in the list. Unrelated in-flight items are not
  bundled in to ride along on the same approval.

## Checkpoints

- Adding an item to `release-candidate-dev/` creates an expectation that a dev build/deploy is
  coming next.
- Every dev deploy reviews **every** item currently in `release-candidate-dev/`. For each, ask
  directly: "did this get verified? Promote to `release-candidate/`, or demote?"
- A demoted item's target (`current/` or `backlog/`) is decided in the moment by asking — there is
  no fixed rule for which one applies.
- This checkpoint is a blocking step inside the dev-publish script itself, using the standard
  script-prompt / actor-input loop.

## Production release

- Everything in `release-candidate/` at release time is, by definition, part of the release — no
  diff-matching needed.
- At the start of a new production release: empty `completed/` (delete what the previous release
  left there) and commit that deletion, then batch-move everything from `release-candidate/` into
  `completed/`, then create the release tag and push. `completed/` never accumulates across
  releases; full history stays recoverable through git log.
- The release script may use both the raw diff and the `release-candidate/` item files together to
  ground release-notes generation.

## Dev deploys never touch PM state outside the checkpoint above

No other PM folder transition happens on a dev deploy.
