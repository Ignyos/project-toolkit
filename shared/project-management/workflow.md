# PM Workflow Rules

`project-management.md` is a pure index. This file owns the rules. See `AGENTS.md` for current
direction and priorities — this file only defines process.

## Lifecycle

`backlog/` -> `current/` -> `release-candidate-dev/` -> `release-candidate/` -> `completed/`

Moving an item between folders is a plain file move. Its id (for example `bug-001`, `feat-002`)
never changes.

## Ids and prefixes

Per-prefix counters, not a global counter: `bug-001`, `bug-002`, ... and `feat-001`, `feat-002`, ...
counted separately. Starter prefixes: `bug`, `feat`, `chore`, `task`, `spike`.

## Checkpoints

- Adding an item to `release-candidate-dev/` creates an expectation that a dev build/deploy is
  coming next.
- Every dev deploy reviews **every** item currently in `release-candidate-dev/`. For each, ask
  directly: "did this get verified? Promote to `release-candidate/`, or demote?"
- A demoted item's target (`current/` or `backlog/`) is decided in the moment by asking — there is
  no fixed rule for which one applies.
- This checkpoint is a blocking step inside the dev-publish script itself, using the standard
  script-prompt / actor-input loop.

## Production release

- Everything in `release-candidate/` at release time is, by definition, part of the release — no
  diff-matching needed.
- At the start of a new production release: empty `completed/` (delete what the previous release
  left there) and commit that deletion, then batch-move everything from `release-candidate/` into
  `completed/`, then create the release tag and push. `completed/` never accumulates across
  releases; full history stays recoverable through git log.
- The release script may use both the raw diff and the `release-candidate/` item files together to
  ground release-notes generation.

## Dev deploys never touch PM state outside the checkpoint above

No other PM folder transition happens on a dev deploy.
